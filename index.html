        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! My name is Nary Pay. I am an innovative and detail-oriented student with experience in customer service, multitasking, and organization. I also have the ability to plan and manage time wisely in order to complete necessary tasks in an orderly fashion. I believe that teamwork and dedication are necessary to succeed in a work environment. I possess a friendly and welcoming personality with the goal of giving others a positive and memorable experience. Some of my key strengths include: customer service, multitasking and communication. I have the ability to greet customers with warmth and enthusiasm, along with exceptional listening skills and a keen ability to resolve customer complaints and concerns. My multitasking abilities also allow me to have the capacity to thoroughly and quickly survey my surroundings while completing my work. I am also remarkably competent to judge tremendous tasks efficiently and orderly. My communication skills render me extremely capable of relying information regularly with clarity, fine articulation, and appropriate tone. My communication skills also equip me with the astonishing ability to engage in friendly, welcoming, and professional conversation instantaneously.<br><br>

         I am currently a first year student at UC Riverside. Although, with the units I have completed and transferred over to the university, I am considered a sophomore. I previously attended a middle college when I was in high school. This means that while I was attending high school, I was also dual enrolled at a community college. I completed nearly all of my general education courses. While I was attending high school, I quickly became a respected figure on my school's dance team. Within a month of joining the team, I became a leader on the team in order to fill in the absence of our dance coach. Soon after that, I began to climb up the ranks and within a year, I was vice president, along with the captain of the competition dance team. With this role I had, I was able to drive the team to our first few competitions and lead us towards winning multiple first-place trophies. This is where I found my passion for school and business. I have not declared a concentration in my major yet, as I am still in the pre-business program, I am hoping to concentrate in Management or Marketing as they intrigue me the most.<br><br>

        Not long ago, I could have been found as a babysitter during my free time in order to make extra cash. I babysat 2 kids under the ages of 2, which has proved to be an extremely difficult task. From this job, I have learned to be an extremely patient and orderly person. Kids are known to make lots of messes and cause a lot of fuss, and I have always kept my cool throughout all the hassle. As for any formal work experience, I currently hold a job at Chick Fil A as a team member in order to afford school. Chick Fil A is also known for it's hectic environment, and it's amazing food of course but, it is also known for being extremely efficient. Lines at Chick Fil A normally wrap all around the parking lot, regardless of what time of day it is. Despite this huge obstacle, employees are still able to get people in and out in a snap and are able to satisfy nearly every customer. This has taught me to be very quick on my feet and has also taught me excellent customer service skills.
